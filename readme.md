This is very much a work in progress
This is a Tiki cocktail recipe database
Basic CRUD works
BUT
The interface is crap
BUT
Before continuing on to make more UI improvements and features
I think it's important to build out the recipe database
Then build the UI around the number of cocktails that will be here by default
Plus consider people will be adding their own
